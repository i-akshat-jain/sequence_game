## Key Components Breakdown

### 1. **Connection Phase**
- Socket.IO connection establishment
- Error handling for connection failures
- Loading states and user feedback

### 2. **Room Management**
- Room creation with unique ID generation
- Player joining with name validation
- Admin vs regular player roles
- Room capacity management

### 3. **Game Initialization**
- Game settings configuration (max players, turn time, game mode)
- Card dealing and hand distribution
- Board state initialization
- Turn management setup

### 4. **Gameplay Loop**
- Turn-based gameplay with timer
- Card selection and position validation
- Move processing and state updates
- Sequence detection and win conditions

### 5. **Real-time Synchronization**
- Socket events for state updates
- Multi-player synchronization
- Error handling and reconnection

    S->>C: connected
    
    C->>S: join-room (roomId, playerName, isAdmin)
    S->>R: validate room
    R->>S: room data
    S->>C: joined-room
    S->>C: player-joined (to other players)
    
    C->>S: start-game (roomId, settings)
    S->>R: initialize game
    R->>S: game state
    S->>C: game-started

        C->>S: game-action (card, position)
        S->>R: process move
        R->>S: updated state
        S->>C: game-update
        S->>C: turn-passed (if turn changes)
    end
    
    C->>S: disconnect
    S->>C: player-left (to other players)
```

## State Management

### Client State
- `isConnected`: Socket connection status
- `currentRoom`: Current room data
- `gameState`: Local game state
- `selectedCard`: Currently selected card
- `selectedPosition`: Currently selected position

### Server State
- `gameRooms`: Map of active rooms
- `players`: Map of players in each room
- `gameState`: Current game state per room
- `settings`: Room configuration
- `timers`: Turn timers per room

## Error Handling

1. **Connection Errors**: Auto-reconnection attempts
2. **Room Errors**: Clear error messages for invalid rooms
3. **Game Errors**: Validation for moves and actions
4. **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation and recovery

## Key Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Socket.IO for instant updates
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Timer-based turn management
- **Room System**: Create/join rooms with unique IDs
- **Admin Controls**: Room creator manages game settings
- **Sequence Detection**: Automatic win condition checking
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and reconnection
